This is a simple application that allows you to share anecdotes with friends in a fun way.

## Concept

Let a cycle be a set of times (e.g 7 days).

Every cycle each user will be able to do several actions:
- write an anecdote
- try to guess who has written each anecdote of the previous cycle
- see the result of every user in the room for the answers to the anecdotes two cycles ago

## Todo

- Everything that is marked todo in the code
- Add a way to create rooms with the interface
- Add structure of database
